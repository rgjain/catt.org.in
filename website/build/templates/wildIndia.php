						<h3><a href="http://ncf-india.org/" >NCF - Nature Conservation foundation</a></h3>
						<div>
							At the Nature Conservation Foundation, our goal is to contribute to the knowledge and conservation of India's unique wildlife heritage with innovative research and imaginative solutions. We work in a range of wildlife habitats, from coral reefs and tropical rainforests to the high mountains of the Himalaya.Â Here, we strive to understand the survival needs of endangered species such as snow leopards and elephants, as well as equally fascinating but lesser-known wildlife such as corals and spiders. Our research also addresses human resource-use and its impacts on wild species and ecosystems. Using this knowledge of wildlife ecology and human society, we design conservation strategies that are locally-appropriate. These are implemented in collaboration with local communities who depend the most on natural resources, and the governments that manage them. While promoting wildlife conservation, our programmes also strive to safeguard livelihood and development options for local communities.
